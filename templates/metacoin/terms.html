                    <li><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>

                    <br><br>

                    <p>1.1 This agreement, along with the Company’s Risk Disclosure Document, as well as any other documents referred to in this Agreement or any other agreement entered into between the Company and the Client, all as amended from time to time (together the “Agreement”), set out the terms upon which the Company will deal with the Client in respect of foreign exchange transactions and CFD’s (contracts for differences) (“Forex Trading”)</p></li>

                    <li><strong>OPENING OF THE TRADING ACCOUNT</strong>

                    <br><br>

                    <p>2.1 The Company will open an account for the Client (the “Trading Account”) as soon as reasonably practicable after: (i) the Company has received confirmation that the Client has agreed to enter into this Agreement, together with a completed application form (if applicable) and all other information on the Client required by the Company to be provided. The Client confirms that all information provided by it is full, accurate and complete. If there is a change in relation to any of the information provided by the Client, the Client must notify the Company immediately of any such change.</p>

                    <p>2.2 The Trading Account will be activated by the Company as soon as the Company has identified the funds credited by the Client to the Trading Account. However, if the Company opens a Trading Account and funds are credited to it before the Company is satisfied that all requirements in relation to the opening of such Trading Account under Applicable Regulations (for example, in relation to the prevention of money laundering) have been complied with, then either: (i) the Company need not activate the Trading Account and in such circumstances no trading shall be permitted in relation to a Trading Account; or (ii) the Company may activate the Trading Account and permit trading in relation to the Trading Account subject to such limitations, and to the satisfaction of such further requirements in relation to the opening of such Trading Account under Applicable Regulations as the Company may impose (for example, in relation to the provision of further information on the identity of the Client). In the event that a Trading Account is activated but any such requirements are not complied with, the Company may freeze the Trading Account by closing out all existing positions and no further trading shall be permitted in relation to the Trading Account. Where a Trading Account is not activated or is frozen, no funds held by the Company in respect of that Trading Account may be transferred back or to any other person until the Company is satisfied that all Applicable Regulations have been complied with.</p>

                    <p>2.3 In relation to any Transaction entered into pursuant to the Agreement the Company may act, according to the Company’s sole discretion as principal or as agent on the Client’s behalf. Therefore the Company may act as the counter party to the Clients Trading activity. The Client confirms that it acts as principal and not as agent (or trustee) on behalf of someone else. Accordingly, the Client agrees that it shall be directly and fully responsible for performing the obligations of the Client under this Agreement, including in respect of each Transaction made by or on behalf of the Client. The Company shall not accept any other person as an indirect client in respect of this Agreement and shall accept no obligation to any such person unless otherwise specifically agreed in writing.</p>

The Company may cancel the Client withdrawal order, if, according to the Company’s discretion, the remaining funds (after the withdrawal) shall not be sufficient to secure open Positions in the Trading Account.</p>

                    <p>3.10 The Company shall debit the Client’s Trading Account for all payment charges. If the Client has the obligation to pay any amount to the Company which exceeds the amount held in the Client’s Trading Account, the Client shall pay the amount of any such excess forthwith upon the obligation arising.</p>

                    </li>


                    <li><strong>ORDERS TYPES</strong>

                    <br><br>

                    <p>6.1 Client acknowledges and agrees that the Trading Platform made available to the Client by the Company follows the market for the relevant trader, whether the trader is in front of his computer or not and whether the computer itself was switched on or not and exercises the order left by the trader when market conditions satisfy the trader’s request.</p>

                    <p>6.2 Limit Order – A Limit Order is an instruction to trade at a level that becomes more favourable to the Client. A Limit Order can be used to open or close a position. Each Limit Order has a specified price limit set by the Client (but subject to the Company’s agreement). A Limit Order will be triggered if the Company’s bid price (in the case a sell order) or ask price (in the case of a buy order) moves in the Client’s favour to a point where the Client’s order can be executed. Once the limit level is triggered, the Company will seek to execute the order at that price. If the Company cannot do so (e.g. because in attempting to execute the order, the price becomes less favourable to the Client), the limit order will remain operational, waiting for the price to move again in the Client’s favour, such that it is triggered again.</p>

                    <p>6.3 Stop Order – A Stop Order is generally placed to provide some risk protection, for example, in the event of the Client’s position moving into loss. A Stop Order can also be used to either open or close a position. Each Stop Order has a specific stop level, set by the client (but subject to the Company’s agreement). The Stop Order will be triggered only if a transaction takes place on the Company’s trading platform at that stop level. Once the Stop Order is triggered, the Company will seek to execute the order at a level that is the same as the stop level (although it may be at a less favourable level).</p>

                    <p>6.4 Other orders – such as OCO’S (One Cancels the Other), ID’s (If Done’s) – Trailing Stops etc., and more information, is described in the Company’s website.</p>

                    <p>6.5 Rollovers or Swaps – The Company performs all the overnight rollovers (continuation of a trade) automatically, and there is no need for trader intervention. Such rollovers are accommodated with interest debits or credits to the Trader’s Trading Account. This is based on the interest rate differentials between currency pairs and taking into account the Company’s own costs. All open positions are automatically rolled over by. The Client’s position may either receive or be charged rollover, depending on whether the position is long or short the high interest rate currency.</p>

                    <p>6.6 Margin call – The Client agrees to pay the Company, on demand, such sums by way of margin as are required from time to time under the rules of any relevant market (if applicable) or as the Company may in its sole discretion require for the purpose of protecting the Company against loss or risk of loss on present, future or contemplated Transactions under this Agreement. In the event that the client fails to meet a margin call, the Company may close out the Client’s position(s). The Client acknowledges and agrees that this may result in a Transaction being closed out at a less favourable time than might otherwise be the case and the Company shall not have any liability to the Client as a result of it closing out any Transaction in such circumstances.</p>
